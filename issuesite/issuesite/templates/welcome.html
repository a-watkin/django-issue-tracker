        So I've tried to meet all your use cases. I wasn't really sure what role the staff account described in the specifications should have. Whether you wanted a longin for account or something along those lines.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since it's not mentioned explicitly and the staff role described can't do anything I've implemented the issues list without any login.
        </p>

        <p>
        Instead I've assumed that staff users can solve problems but only admin can accept solutions and attribute them to that staff user. So staff users are simply the solver in the database model.
        </p>

        <p>
        The admin account can create, change and delete issues. It can also do the same for StaffUsers.
        </p>

        <p>
        Admin account login:

        <ul>
            <li>
                username: admin
            </li>
            <li>
                password: adminpassword
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
        Staff role is implemented as: StaffUser in the model. One StaffUser has been created via the admin console.

        StaffUser credentials:

        <ul>
            <li>
                username: a_staff_user
            </li>
            <li>
                password: staffpassword
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        

        The StaffUser account cannot login or alter anything, it can only be assigned as the solver to an issue.
        </p>
